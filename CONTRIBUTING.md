## Development

#### Prerequisites

- [Git](https://git-scm.com/)

#### Step 1: Clone the WAM repo and install its dependencies

```bash
git clone https://github.com/rl-institut/WAM.git
cd WAM
```

By default you should stand on the `dev` branch, you can check this with 
```bash
git status
```

or

```bash
git branch --list
```

#### Step 2: Develop

Development of a feature for this repository should follow the workflow described 
by [Vincent Driessen](https://nvie.com/posts/a-successful-git-branching-model/).

Here are the minimal procedure you should follow : 


0. Create [an issue](https://help.github.com/en/articles/creating-an-issue) on the github repository, describing the problem you will then address with your feature/fix.
This is an important step as it forces one to think about the issue (to describe an issue to others, one has to think it through first).

1. Create a separate branch from `dev`, to work on
```bash
git checkout -b myfeature dev
```
2. Try to follow [these conventions](https://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit) for commit messages:
- Keep the subject line [short](https://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/#limit-50) (i.e. do not commit more than a few changes at the time)
- Use [imperative](https://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/#imperative) for commit messages 
- Do not end the commit message with a [period](https://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/#end) 
You can use 
```bash
git commit --amend
```
to edit the commit message of your latest commit (provided it is not already pushed on the remote server).
With `--amend` you can even add/modify changes to the commit.

3. Push your local branch on the remote server `origin`
```bash
git push
```
If your branch does not exist on the remote server yet, git will provide you with instructions, simply follow them.


#### Step 3: Run tests locally

To run integration tests locally:
```bash
pip install -r tests/test_requirements.txt
```

The tests which are currently automated are linting tests, you can run them locally by copying the scripts under the comment
`# command to run tests` of the `.travis.yml` file.

We want more integration tests.

We do not have a suite of unit tests yet.

#### Step 4: Submit a pull request (PR)

Follow the [steps](https://help.github.com/en/articles/creating-a-pull-request) of the github help to create the PR.
Please note that you PR should be directed from your branch (for example `myfeature`) towards the branch `dev`.

Add a line `Fix #<number of the issue created in Step 2.0>` in the description of your PR, so that when it is merged, it automatically closes the issue.

TODO elaborate on the pull request
